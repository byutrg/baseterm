# BaseTerm

A Symfony project created on September 16, 2015, 3:57 pm.

BaseTerm is an open-source and free to use terminology management system built with the primary goal of natively supporting the most popular TBX dialect for exchange, TBX-Basic.

## Installation

BaseTerm uses Apache, PHP5, and MySQL (it has been tested using Linux, Windows (Wampserver), and Mac(MAMP)).

### Clone Repository

Clone this git repository to the desired directory on your Apache webserver setup.

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/byutrgteam/baseterm.git
```

Enter the directory:

```
cd baseterm
```

### Setup MySQL Database and Install Symfony

You will need to create a database for BaseTerm in MySQL along with a user and a password.

Now you must install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).  You can download it from the website or do the following:

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --filename=composer
```

Once you have composer in the main directory, you must run it:

```
php composer install
```

This should install Symfony and all other requirements for BaseTerm.  You will need to provide information about your MySQL instance.  If you do not know yet, these settings can changed later in the app/config/parameters.yml file.

### Prepare the site

From the main directory run the following:

#### Update the database
```
php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

After initializing the database, you will need to import "langauges_regions.sql" located in the "app" directory to have access to Langauges and Regions.  In the future this will be changed to happen automatically.

#### Publish

##### Publish to the Development environment
```
php app/console assetic:dump --env=dev
```

##### Publish to the Production environment
```
php app/console assetic:dump --env=prod
```

#### Clear Cache

Note, you may need to fix permissions for the app/cache and app/logs folders after doing this:

```
php app/console cache:clear
```

#### Promote User

After accessing BaseTerm and creating your first user, you will need to promote them to admin.  After this all permissions can be handled internally within BaseTerm.

```
php app\console fos:user:promote [USERNAME] ROLE_ADMIN
```

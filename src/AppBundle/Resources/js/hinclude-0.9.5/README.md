Tired of regenerating HTML pages from templates? Want more from Web caches?
*HInclude* makes one thing very easy; including other bits of HTML into your
Web page, _using the browser_.

HInclude is declarative client-side inclusion for the Web; it allows easy
composition of Web pages using the browser -- making your pages more modular,
more cacheable, and easier to maintain. 

See [the demo page](http://mnot.github.com/hinclude/) for documentation and
examples.
